    <p>
      At Kozy Baby, we take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy outlines
      how we collect, use, and protect your personal data.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Collection and Storage</h2>
    <p>
      We do not store any personal data on the web. All information and data
      generated by the app are stored locally on your phone. Your data remains
      private and secure within your device, and we do not transmit or store it
      on any servers or third-party services.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Usage</h2>
    <p>
      The app only uses data stored locally on your phone to provide the
      features and functionality you request. We do not access or share any of
      your data with external entities.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      Since your data is stored only on your phone, it is protected by the
      security measures of your device. We encourage you to ensure that your
      phone is secured with a password, fingerprint, or other security features
      provided by your operating system.
    </p>

    <h2>No Web Data Storage</h2>
    <p>
      To clarify, no data collected by the app is stored on any web servers.
      Everything remains strictly on your device, providing you with full
      control over your personal information.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be
      reflected within the app, and we encourage you to review the policy
      periodically.
